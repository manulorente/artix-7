# Xilinx Artix7 FPGA library

This repository contains a collection of projects that can be reused in the development of FPGA applications using Xilinx Vivado.

## Projects

- [Basic](basic/): A basic project that blinks an LED on the FPGA board.
- [CD4RE](cd4re/): A project that implements a counter that counts up to 4 and then resets.
